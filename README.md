# Pocket DM
> This app simulates the rolling of a one hundred-sided die, to be used alongside the popular TTRPG, Dungeons & Dragons.

In my experience as a Dungeon Master, I have tried to implement randomness into my games by using two ten-sided dice (D10) to get a tens and ones digit, representing a number between 1-100, in order to choose from a series of random events on a table. After a while, it becomes difficult to keep track of all the different scenarios and results, so I decided to start working on this program! My future goal is to turn this into sort of a "Pocket DM", to help future gamers streamline their TTRPG experience.
